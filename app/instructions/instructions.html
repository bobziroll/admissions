        Welcome to the V School admissions project! Your task, simply put, is to "hack" this website.
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of this admissions project is to test both your <strong>resilience</strong> and <strong>resourcefulness</strong>. A lot
        of what you'll be required to do
        may be completely foreign to you and could even prove frustrating to figure out. <strong>You are not required to finish this within
        a certain amount of time.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        We've included clues throughout the texts to help guide you in the process, but you will be required to figure certain things out
        for
        yourself. <strong>You may use any resource available to you EXCEPT asking for help from another person.</strong> As a starting
        point, you should definitely do some research on the "Chrome Developer Tools," as they will be invaluable to you in this process. In
        fact, if you work your way through
        <a href="http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/" target="_blank">this Code School course</a> from beginning to end and can mostly
        understand what it teaches, this project should be fairly simple for you.
    </p>
    <p>In real-life situations, you're highly encouraged to get help from other people <em>after spending a good amount of time trying to
        figure
        things out on
        your own</em>, but for the purposes of this project you'll need to do everything by yourself.
    </p>
    <p>For this project, we highly recommend the following setup:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Required:</strong> Use the Google Chrome web browser to complete this project. <a
                href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/">You can download it here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Resize your browser's window to mostly or completely fit the screen you're using.</li>
        <li>Dock your Chrome Dev Tools on the bottom instead of on the right of the screen. For instructions on how to do this, check
            <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10023640/how-to-reposition-chrome-developer-tools" target="_blank">this Stack
                Overflow post</a>.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you close this page, your progress will be reset.</p>
    <p>
        Although you will be asked to look at and debug parts of this site, no previous programming experience is necessary to complete this
        challenge.
