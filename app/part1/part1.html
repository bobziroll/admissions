    <h3>Part 1</h3>
    <p>In web development, JavaScript plays a huge part in making websites and web applications with useful, beautiful user
        interactions.</p>
    <p>When we write something incorrectly in the JavaScript, it has a tendency to break lots of things on our page.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, there's a handy tool available to developers to allow them to inspect code and even make some temporary changes right in
        the browser!</p>
    <p>We've manually triggered a JavaScript error. You need to find out how to view that error, because it contains the password that you
        need to move forward.</p>

    <div class="form-group">
        <input type="text" placeholder="Password" class="form-control" ng-model="pass1">
        <button class="btn btn-lg btn-success" ng-click="testPassword(pass1, '1')">Next</button>
